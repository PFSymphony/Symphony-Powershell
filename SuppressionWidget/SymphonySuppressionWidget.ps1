# Notes on the Script

    # This Powershell script performs a one-time requests to suppress a message.
    # It requires the messageID of the message that should be suppressed.  MessageID is of the format
    #     eU8++8VJ7dA8O7vCkvno73///qOBg+l3dA==
    # The widget will convert it to URL safe, and suppress the message.
